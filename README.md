# Introduction:
Greeintg Traveler `\(^ O ^)/`
  I'm elated to present you my new project. By the way this project is for my 2nd semester. It's based on C++ programing language, and I have also used an external library for graphic that is SFML(Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

# Team:
  Heroes who accompany me during this adventure are Healer Ameer Hamza `/(Q , Q)\` (ameerhamza3463) 
  and Clumsy Aneeq Muneer `(W o W)` (Aneeq-Muneer).

# How to Run Code:
  ## Softwares:
    Visual Studio.
