# ROA12-
# Introduction:
Greeintg Traveler `\(^ O ^)/`
  I'm elated to present you my new project. By the way this project is for my 2nd semester. It's based on C++ programing language, and I have also used an external library for graphic that is SFML(Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
  ROA12 is a basic Android simulator. It provides the basic functionalities & experience of some apps of android to it's user. We have include Message App, Notes, and Calculator.

  ## Walkthrough To Include The Library
   Travelers ( ╹▽╹ ) !!! Now I will explain to you guys How to include SFML to run the project.
     * Step 01: Click on the video link.
       LINK: https://youtu.be/I6CckuSptP0?t=89
     * Step 02: Watch it.      
     * Step 03: Do the same.
     * That's All Folks <(￣︶￣)>
  
   BUT in the video, I have made a new project, and it is not the requirement for you since you have the project (ROA12). So watch the video from 01:29 to save your time. It's alright if you want the full video,  but it will be just waste of your precious time, won't it? (￣ヘ￣;)
